# Gabagool Lab — STATE

> Resume protocol: read CHARTER.md, then this file, then the tail of
> JOURNAL.md. That is enough to continue. Everything else is detail.
> Pickup ritual additions: (1) verify `gabagool-lab/DONE` does NOT
> exist (stray external one appeared 2026-07-17T05:17Z, purged u14a;
> hook blocks re-adds unless GLAB_L3_DONE=yes); (2) never bare
> `git add -A` — stage explicitly; (3) OPERATOR-FEED entry EVERY unit,
> same commit (s3 skipped 4 — backfilled u18; don't repeat); (4) stamp
> journal entries from `date -u` output only, never estimates (every
> session so far has drifted ahead when estimating).

## Status digest

- **Session:** 12 (started 2026-07-17T06:52Z. Stamp rule: paste from
  `date -u` output captured in the same command — every estimate so
  far has drifted. TZ note: this box is UTC+2; raw `stat` mtimes
  print LOCAL — subtract 2h)
- **Ladder rung:** L2 IN PROGRESS — E004 JUDGED (u33); E005 shapes
  FROZEN + LAUNCHED (u34), draining
- **Phase:** E005 shapes draining (launched 07:30Z at freeze SHA
  7355c21a; 6 flows ax3{h1,h2}×{rb,rc,rd}, 17,568 jobs; ETA
  ~08:05–08:10Z at E004 pace). Watcher: nohup pid 87197 →
  logs/watch-drain-s12-e005-shapes.log. Reference arm ra = E003
  runs 682/683 (NOT resubmitted). E004 verdict: LEDGER §E004 (H6
  survives; cfree best cell −3.4665/−3.3541 via inventory removal;
  caps dead; maker-only confirmations, D-008; LS-7/LS-8). E003:
  §E003 (tighter better; floor −4.39; SEED=2). EVALUATION v1.1
  frozen (TAIL_K 41, G11 0.92/$100, D-007). s12 ritual done: KB@A33
  no-new, feeds unchanged (binance only)
- **Branch:** gabagool-lab (worktree at ~/Sites/polymarket-bot-gabagool-lab)
- **Write scope:** gabagool-lab/ + src/strategies/gabagool-lab/ (hook enforces)

## What exists so far

- L0 COMPLETE (session 1): INHERITANCE (folded through KB **A33**),
  EPISTEMOLOGY v1, EVALUATION **v1.1** (frozen; v1.1 = TAIL_K 41 +
  G11 per D-007), LEDGER (E001+E002 judged), tools (submit/results/
  runs/inspect-meta/queue/agg-inspect/calibrate/watch-drain +
  launch-e003.sh — DB-tested), E001 smoke green twice.
- **E004 JUDGED (u33, s12): H6 SURVIVES (spread 1.99%/2.24% of
  turnover vs 0.3% kill). cfree (free completion) best cell yet:
  EL −3.4665/−3.3541 (runs 694/695), DISTINCT vs c990 both halves;
  caps c970/c990 ≈ none (dead region logged). Mechanism (e004-
  decomp.ts, exact): completion wins by REMOVAL (maker fills −26%,
  conversions −39%, imb p90 1.000→0.335) despite S>1 pairs (locked
  ~2c loss each). Advance rule FAILED (tied middle) → candidate
  confirmations maker-only; D-008 = completion may enter a frozen
  candidate spec only. cfree forfeits ~$1/mkt winner remainders →
  E-completion-selective seeded. LS-7 + LS-8.**
- **L1 COMPLETE (unit 14): E002 fullwin battery, runs 675/678/676/677
  (lat0/140/500/1000), 5,856 mkts each, 0 failed, validators green.
  EL −0.42/−4.39/−5.03/−5.30; 0/36 arm-weeks positive; taker
  conversions 0/34%/48%/55% of fills; pairRate 0.291 at lat0 with
  imbalance p50=1.00. Verdict AXIS-CLOSED (shallow-requote region
  dead). Reference to beat: EL(140) −4.39, frictionless bound −0.42.
  Central mechanism: requote churn × latency = involuntary taker;
  quote-stability is a design axis. LEADERBOARD has the row + first
  dead region.**
- **E003 JUDGED (u27, s11): AXIS-CLOSED. Runs 681–690 (5 tol arms ×
  Apr/May halves, lat140), all validators green. Tighter parity
  strictly better (trend −1 both halves; endpoints distinct), but
  best arm = floor = E002 baseline −4.39 exactly (bit-identical
  reproduction, 74,111m/38,144t fills). Mechanism: loose parity
  admits adverse one-sided inventory (−21c/marginal fill at tol 40),
  taker share flat, pairRate falls. SEED=2 for E004/E005; loose
  {20,40} in dead regions; LS-6 (floored arms collapse — state
  effective grids).**
- KB folds: A-1..A-5 in INHERITANCE (A30/A33 deep-pair = best-evidenced
  region; A32 maker-only cells tier-immune; A26 no-blow-up prior;
  A-5 = W2 capital anchor $0.9k/mkt p50 + W7 terrain: btc-15m flow
  down ~9× from Jan peak — cite in capacity notes and monthly-trend
  attribution). KB register still tops at A33 (checked s4 05:45Z).
- Key capability: intent_meta shared-accumulator persists BY REFERENCE →
  exact per-fill economics in DB. Export: results.ts --run N --export
  <path.csv>; battery: --battery id@lat,id@lat,...
- **Worker daemon (survives session death):** `nohup caffeinate -is
  ./scripts/run-worker.sh --queues markets,aggregate
  --market-concurrency 4` from THIS worktree, log →
  `gabagool-lab/logs/worker-fullwin-s2.log`, code at 6de8fa0. Check
  `npx tsx gabagool-lab/tools/queue.ts` + `ps auxww | grep run-worker`.
  If dead: relaunch same way. The 3 failed jobs in the aggregate queue
  are stale foreign `imbalance-hold` duplicates — NOT mine, ignore.

## Queue (work top to bottom)

1. **E005 shape sub-judgment when drained (watcher log
   watch-drain-s12-e005-shapes.log says DRAINED; ETA ~08:05–08:10Z):**
   6 runs (uids in §E005) + reused ra = 682/683. Per frozen criteria:
   per-arm readout (EL±se, taker share, pairRate, imb p50/p90,
   outlay, fills, PLAYED SHARE — LS-6 asymmetric-band note),
   adjacency + advance rule (direction agreement + top-2 set match,
   as E003), rd read as PACKAGE not pure depth. Categorical codes:
   check whether axis-table.ts can wire ra=682,683 explicitly (E004
   lesson) or whether e004-table-style wiring is needed.
2. **Cap-grid finalization decision (pre-registered §E005 rule):**
   from the shape winner's run pair compute bind(c) table from
   per-market S; KEEP {0.96,0.97,0.98} iff bind(0.96)−bind(0.98) ≥
   0.15 AND bind(0.98) ≥ 0.05, else quartile grid. Record table +
   decision in §E005 BEFORE submitting cap arms (ax4).
3. **Launch + judge E005 cap arms (ax4).** Then E006 timing. Seeds
   in LEDGER backlog (incl. E-completion-selective from E004).

## Open questions / risks

- Feeds: binanceWsSpotPrice replayable NOW; price-to-beat + Chainlink
  NOT landed (re-checked origin/main 05:45Z s4 — only binance sub-feed
  available per src/backtest/feeds/wireBacktestExternalFeeds.ts, note
  the path; H4 strike proxy = window-open spot).
- KB folded through A33 + W2/W7 measurements (A-5); KB is in PHASE 2
  (open-ended, operator reopened; its new #1 = 0x04b6d7e9 deep-dive).
  Re-read KB STATE every session.
- Telonex coverage ends 2026-06-14; July meta not replayable until
  operator resumes sync.
- Remote fleet tracks origin/main — not mine; local worker only.
- Disk at 98% (~9.7Gi free) — keep artifacts lean; exports gitignored.
- Ask for operator (non-blocking): CLI/env passthrough for
  makerFillMode=touch_or_better would enable fill-model bracketing.
