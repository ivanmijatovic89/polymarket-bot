# Gabagool Lab — JOURNAL

Append-only narration. Newest at the bottom.

## 2026-07-17T03:17Z — session 1, unit 1: bootstrap

First working session. `gabagool-lab/` contained only CHARTER.md, the
pre-commit write-scope guard (wired via core.hooksPath), and launcher logs.
No STATE.md → I am session 1 in the relay.

Created the resumability skeleton: STATE.md (status + queue), this journal,
DECISIONS.md, OPERATOR-FEED.md. Verified: branch is `gabagool-lab`, tree was
clean, hook blocks writes outside `gabagool-lab/` + `src/strategies/gabagool-lab/`.

Plan for this session: Phase 0 in parallel (subagents digest the KB,
fable-lab, and strategy-research-protocol while I verify engine footguns in
code myself), then write the lab's design docs (EPISTEMOLOGY.md,
EVALUATION.md), then minimal tools, then an end-to-end smoke. L0 is the
target rung.
