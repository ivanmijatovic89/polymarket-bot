# JOURNAL — pair-fable

## 2026-07-30 — Session 1 (initializer)

- Read RULES and mission 01; confirmed I am the initializer (no PLAN.json).
- Surveyed the engine with five parallel code readers (backtest CLI, result
  storage/metrics, strategy system, execution simulator, fleet/queues) and
  spot-checked the load-bearing claims by hand.
- Key findings worth the human's eye:
  - `--extend` does not replay the parent run's latency despite comments
    claiming it — filed as proposal P-001; until fixed, latency-pinned runs
    are treated as non-extendable.
  - Invested-capital per market is computed during replay but never stored —
    filed as P-002; capital-aware units may need it (a protocol-side
    workaround exists for no-sell strategies and will be verified).
  - Good news for the strategy: the engine's `ctx.metrics.position` already
    computes exactly our pair quantities (mergeable shares, pair average
    price, merge PnL, imbalance), maker fills cost $0 in fees, and
    settlement automatically values held pairs at $1 — no merge intent
    needed in backtests, exactly as RULES prescribes.
- Wrote `state/PLAN.json`: 10 single-session items — two run-verification
  items (local smoke, fleet round-trip), parity boundary map, capital-aware
  units, two tool-building items, a baseline pair strategy to prove the loop
  end-to-end, evaluator design, the capability-refresh procedure, and the
  final READY review.
- Created the memory system (`memory/INDEX.md` + `capabilities/` seeded with
  evidence-tagged notes, `experiments/`, `process/`) and the `tools/`
  skeleton with naming and conventions.
